# SnakeDemo
 Unity Demo reel for job postulation

Entire project made in Unity.

Instructions provided:
* Have a home screen that has a button that starts the game. When you press that button, the home screen has to go up with an animation.
* Have a character (it can be a cube) that is on a platform. When clicking somewhere on the platform, the character has to move to that place,
* There must be immovable blocks of obstacles, which serve as walls.
* 3/4 view (Top/side), all 3D except the interface.
* There must be 3 collectibles. Each time the character touches one, it disappears and a sound of your choice plays.
* When grabbing the 3 objects, the character must rotate accelerating to a certain point, then change shape or color and start to slow down until it reaches its original rotation and stops rotating. There will appear a game over message (with some animation).
* There should be a countdown time marker that is visible all the time in the interface. If you don't collect all 3 items in time (counter reaches 0). A GameOver message (with some animation) should appear.

Every asset used not provided by Unity was use just for demonstration purposes, and in no way shape or form any compensation will come out from this project.
